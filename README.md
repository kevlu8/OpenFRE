# OpenFRE (BETA)
Tired of getting malware when trying to find a good script injector? OpenFRE is the solution!

Our name stands for "Open Source Free Roblox Executor".

## Open Beta
This is an open beta, meaning that anyone can use it while it is still being developed.
**However, this does not mean that everything will work. Expect many bugs, and we recommend that you only download from the official [Releases](https://github.com/kevlu8/OpenFRE/releases).**

## WARNING:
While this program is still in the beta phase, we recommend that you **DO NOT** use this program. We have not yet implemented ANY anti-anti-cheat measures, meaning that Roblox will be able to tell if you inject a DLL into the program due to their advanced checking. 

### **WE ARE NOT RESPOSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE CAUSED TO YOUR ROBLOX ACCOUT.**
