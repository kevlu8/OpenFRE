# OpenFRE (BETA)
Tired of getting malware when trying to find a good script injector? OpenFRE is the solution!

Our name stands for "Open Source Free Roblox Executor".

## Open Beta
This is an open beta, meaning that anyone can use it while it is still being developed.
**However, this does not mean that everything will work. Expect many bugs, and we recommend that you only download from the official [Releases](https://github.com/kevlu8/OpenFRE/releases).**
